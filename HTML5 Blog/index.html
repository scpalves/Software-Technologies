                        First the gods bled, and then they died. SK telecom T1â€™s quest for a three-peat was ended by Samsung Galaxy in a thrilling 3-0 match. This marks the end to the heartbreak they suffered almost exactly a year ago when they fell short against SKT in Los Angeles.

                <p>Last night saw the finalisation of ESL One New York 2017, where FaZe Clan managed a 3-0 map victory against Team Liquid in the grand final. A grand total of $125,000 was obtained by the team for first place, whilst the American roster would subsequently have to do with $50,000. Whilst the series adhered to a best-of-five format, only three maps were played in the end, as FaZe Clan came out with an incredibly convincing performance.n absolute disaster of a start for the local representatives, as immense struggle was experienced by Team Liquid on the T side of the map. Over the entire first half Team Liquid was unable to produce a single round, destroying any chance of a comeback on inferno.

                    <h3>Far Cry 5</h3>
                    <p>
                    Platform(s): PS4, Xbox One, PC
                    Release date: February 27, 2018 Far Cry 5 won't take place in some exotic far-off region like Far Cry 4's Kyrat, or an ancient history setting as in Far Cry Primal - it'll be bringing its first-person mayhem to the US of A. The fictional region of Hope County, Montana is thrown into disarray by a cult known as the Project at Eden's Gate, led by the charismatic Father Joseph who advocates religious fanaticism and militia-style stockpiles of high-powered firearms. As Hope County's newest deputy sheriff, you'll have to band with the unturned townsfolk to take down Eden's Gate in the most chaotic ways possible - including aerial dogfights and bombing runs in a pilotable plane, or vicious takedowns using pitchforks, sledgehammers, or trusty animal companions, to name a few options.
